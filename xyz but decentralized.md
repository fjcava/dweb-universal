# Xyz but decentralized
How do we build versions of the tools we love but decentralized.

Who is doing this? 

This list (ironically) on github is a centralized list of applications, that I (Mitra) am adding to as I do my own research. Pull requests are very welcome. 

See [Dweb document index](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-transports/blob/master/DOCUMENTINDEX.md) for a list of the repos that make up the Internet Archive's Dweb project, and an index of other documents. 

## Projects by category

### Version Control (Git)

#### Gitverse 
https://github.com/noffle/gitverse

Positive
* there is no “origin”, run your own p2p server. 

Negative
* there is no “origin” so you have no idea if you are running the stable version
* missing the social/organizational side of github

## Toolkits for building

* [@internetarchive/dweb-transports](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-transports) - common transport layer to IPFS, GUN, WEBTORRENT, HTTP etc
* [@internetarchive/dweb-objects](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-objects) - library of classes to make tool building easier, e.g. Authentication, naming etc

## Other lists

Other people have lists which might be useful for finding xyz but decentralized, please add them here.

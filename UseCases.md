# Use Cases for Dweb-Universal

# Overview


# Carl Malamud / India

Current setup
* Runs queries like collection:foo+language:bhangra (one per project I think)
* Does this in Jake's python tool
* Result is big directory of files 10-400TB
* Sneaker net directory
* Either
  * Runs on server in India with little internet access
  * Gives hard disk to viewer
  
Cares about
* Update since 400TB would be quicker if can check (done)
* Run on local disk, not just server - hard [dweb-mirror issue#63](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-mirror/issues/63)
* Compatability with Jake's tool (need to discuss) [dweb-mirror issue#64](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-mirror/issues/64)
* Possibly Branding if becomes part of bigger project (need to discuss policy)
